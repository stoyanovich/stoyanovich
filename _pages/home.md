# Bio

I'm an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/),
and the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/).  I also direct the NYU Tandon Center for Responsible AI, [NYU R/AI](https://airesponsibly.com/), and am a member of Visualization and Data Analytics Research Center, [VIDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/).

My research focuses on responsible data management and analysis: on operationalizing fairness, diversity, transparency, and data protection
in all stages of the data  acquisition and processing lifecycle. I established the Data, Responsibly consortium, and served on the New York City Automated Decision Systems Task Force, by mayoral appointment.
In addition to data ethics, I work on management and analysis of preference data, and on querying large evolving graphs.
I received my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Columbia University, and a B.S. in Computer Science and in Mathematics and Statistics from
 the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.


# Research

My research is in the area of data and knowledge management. My current work is in scope of three projects, see [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).


 - [Data, Responsibly](http://dataresponsibly.com): ethical data management and analysis
 - [DB4Pref](http://db4pref.com): management and analysis of preference data
 - [Portal](https://portaldb.github.io): management and analysis of evolving graphs

Having graduated from college, I spent 5 years in the start-up industry, as a software developer, data architect and database administrator. This experience has motivated me to work with real datasets whenever possible, and to deliver results of my research to the communities of target users, as part of open-source systems or as stand-alone prototypes.
